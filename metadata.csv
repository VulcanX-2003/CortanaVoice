split_cortana1_nosilence_057|Analyzing. Coolant leakage rate is significant. The ship's reactor should already have gone critical. The flood overwhelmed this cruiser and disabled it. The covenant are terrified the flood will repair the ship and use it to escape from Halo. There's

split_cortana1_nosilence_076|We need to go right now. That did it! The engine's gone critical! Based on the current rate of decay we should have 15 minutes to get off the ship. Shut them down, we'll need them later. I disabled the lifeboat signal beacon to throw off Covenant search teams.
split_cortana1_nosilence_077|Other lifeboats probably made it down too. We should search for survivors. I learned how to tap into the grid when I was in the control center.

split_cortana2_nosilence_015|I hung on to. Just keep your head down. There's two of us in here now, remember. Chief, I'm slipping. I'm afraid. She asked me, could I sacrifice you for the mission?
split_cortana2_nosilence_016|Could I watch you dot do the same to me? I remember a sphere of glass. It held a mountain under storm. I feared the storm would shatter.
split_cortana2_nosilence_017|The mountain washed me away. No, oh that's not right. Ah! It was the coins fault! Don't blame me! blame the eagle!
split_cortana2_nosilence_018|I want it to make you strong. Keep you safe. I'm sorry. I can't. This is UNSC AI serial number CTN0452-9. Ali Ali Oxenfree.

split_cortana2_nosilence_020|I don't want to stay. We can't, we can't let it stop us. Not now. Not with everything at stake. We need to buy some time. This reactor, start a chain reaction. Destroy high-

split_cortana2_nosilence_022|Jump! You can make it! It's going to fall, Chief! Jump off! Now! The reactor's starting to fluctuate. Two more cores to go. Keep it up, Chief. It's working. One more will do it. Take it, you.
split_cortana2_nosilence_023|Bastard. We're just getting started. They're chief and exit. Go through that door. I have a lock on a Pelicans IFF transponder. You must have passed it on your way in. Shortcut chief, jump down.

split_cortana2_nosilence_025|Chief, get on the pelican! You heard it, Chief, but not for long. We need to get to Halo, destroy the flood once and for all. An explosion just made us an exit. I'll mark it in your HUD, get moving! Analyzing the route ahead. I have...
split_cortana2_nosilence_026|I've been mostly figured out. Just keep going. I'll update your HUD as quickly as I can. Down the whole chief. Cordors beyond this point have collapsed. I'm looking for an alternate. Careful. They're chief. Into the maintenance tunnel. Drop down.
split_cortana2_nosilence_027|This will put us back on track. Got a new lock. HUD updated. NavPoint updated. Move. Transponder reading clear. Update encordments. Got another paying. Updating your HUD. Signal strong. Adjusting navPoint bearing.

split_cortana2_nosilence_039|Go home, Johnson. Don't look back. If you hadn't destroyed the first Halo Ring, this one wouldn't exist. There wouldn't be a solution. This ring almost killed us once. Now's its second chance. Once we activate the firing sequence...
split_cortana2_nosilence_040|There may not be time to make the portal. Johnson, do you have the frigate? Safe is better than close, Sergeant Major. Halo, it's so new, unfinished. I'm not exactly sure what will happen when we fire it. Yank, I'm sorry.
split_cortana2_nosilence_041|I got us as close to the control room as I could. Shouldn't be hard to find our way. Halo, we fought so hard to stop it all looks so new, unfinished. Control rooms at the top of that tower, Chief, go!
split_cortana2_nosilence_042|The flood have triggered Halo's defenses. Those sentinels? They'll try and stop everything from entering the control room, even you. This platform is unstable, Chief. Chief, I'm sorry, but we have to move. Get outside, Chief.

split_cortana2_nosilence_044|The dawn is on the other side. Keep moving, Chief. There's no time. Chief, we have to move now. Don't let this ring be the end of us, Chief. Come on, Spartan. Go, go, go! There, Johnson's Wardhug.
split_cortana2_nosilence_045|He may save us yet. Drive Chief, head for the frigate. The dawn is close, we can make it. As long as the ground doesn't fall out beneath us. The charging sequence, it's too much for the ring to take.

split_cortana2_nosilence_049|You didn't tell me he was here. Well, we are finally doing what he wanted. No, not again. The grave mind is reaching critical mass. It's trying to rebuild itself on this ring. There, Johnson's Pelican. Take with...
